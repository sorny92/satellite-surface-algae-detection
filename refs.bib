Interesting libraries for loading images from Sentinel-2:

https://github.com/sertit/eoreader
\newline
Maybe:

https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm
\newline
This looks really nice as it also allows to overlay on maps natively:

https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting\_started/introduction.html
\newline
This project is lit!

https://github.com/satellite-image-deep-learning/techniques

https://github.com/acgeospatial/awesome-earthobservation-code
\newline
Lots of datasets!

https://github.com/Seyed-Ali-Ahmadi/Awesome\_Satellite\_Benchmark\_Datasets
\newline
Interesting survery here:

https://github.com/VIROBO-15/Transformer-in-Remote-Sensing
\newline
To visualize custom maps:

https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/quickstart.html

https://github.com/giswqs/geemap
\newline
Too many resources for satellite imaging:

https://github.com/sacridini/Awesome-Geospatial
\newline
Is this really useful?

https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo
\newline
Hmmm video results....
