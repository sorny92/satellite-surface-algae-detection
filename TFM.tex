Interesting libraries for loading images from Sentinel-2:

Maybe:

This looks really nice as it also allows to overlay on maps natively:

This project is lit!

Lots of datasets!

Doing self-supervised learning could be useful to fight the data scarcity.
As the dataset will be small, a self-training step will be useful to generate
a powerful embedding space to the train a classifer:

Interesting survery here:

To visualize custom maps:

Too many resources for satellite imaging:

Is this really useful?

Hmmm video results....
